# DXVK Studio

**DXVK Studio** is a professional, open-source management suite for DXVK on Windows. It transforms the powerful DXVK translation layer from a command-line utility into a sleek, user-friendly desktop application, allowing you to easily install, manage, and configure Vulkan wrappers for your game library.

## Features
- **Smart Game Discovery**: Automatically scans Steam, GOG Galaxy, and Epic Games Store libraries to find installed games.
- **Architecture Detection**: Analyzes PE headers to automatically determine if a game is 32-bit or 64-bit, ensuring the correct DLLs are installed.
- **Engine Management**: Downloads and caches multiple versions of DXVK from GitHub/GitLab, supporting Official, GPL Async, and NVAPI forks.
- **Safe Deployment**: Automatically backs up original system DLLs (`d3d9.dll`, `dxgi.dll`) before installation and offers one-click restoration.
- **Configuration**: Visual editor for `dxvk.conf` to tweak performance settings without editing text files.
- **Monetization**: Open Core model—free source, optional paid binaries/support.

## Background Story
DXVK is an incredible tool that often revitalizes older games and improves performance on modern hardware by translating DirectX calls to Vulkan. However, manual installation is tedious: downloading archives, extracting specific DLLs, managing 32-bit vs 64-bit versions, and editing config files.

I built DXVK Studio to solve this "maintenance hell." I wanted a tool that felt native to Windows, respected user data (backups!), and made high-performance gaming accessible to everyone, not just power users comfortable with the command line.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or 11
- Vulkan-capable GPU drivers
- Node.js 18+ (for development)

### Installation

We offer two ways to get DXVK Studio:

**1. 💎 Support Development (Recommended)**
Get the convenient auto-installer and support the project.

   ```

3. Build and Run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # executable will be in release/ folder
   ```

4. Run Tests:
